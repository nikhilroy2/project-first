<p>A plant has many different parts that perform various functions, the two main parts of the plant are the root and shoot.</p>

<p>Root usually grows under the ground while shoot usually grows above the ground. </p>

<p>The shoot has different parts called the stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. </p>

<p>The stem is the stalk of the plant. It helps the plant to stand upright. It carries water and minerals from the roots to the leaves and carries food prepared by the leaves to the different parts of the plant Branches are parts that grow from the stem. </p>

<p>Leaves grow on the stem and branches. They are usually green due to the presence of chlorophyll, which helps them to prepare food. Leaves have small openings called stomata, through which plants take in and give out air. </p>

<p>Flowers are the reproductive parts of the plant They come in different shapes, sizes and colors. By the process of pollination, many flowers develop into delicious fruits, which are eaten by us. </p>

<p>Roots help to anchor the plant to the ground. They absorb the water and minerals required for the growth of the plant.</p>
