<h2>Benefits of plants</h2>

<p>Plants are really important for the planet and for all living things.</p>

<p>Plants absorb <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> and release <strong>oxygen</strong> from their leaves, which humans and other animals need to breathe.</p>

<p>Living things need plants to live - they eat them and live in them. Plants help to clean water too

<p>Also Plants play an important role in the discovery of new drugs and many blockbuster drugs are derived either directly or indirectly from plants. It's important that we protect biodiversity of plants so that new drug discoveries can be made in the future. This has a huge impact on health and is also an economic benefit.

<p>However, without plants there would be no food. All carbon in proteins, fats and carbohydrates is derived from photosynthesis in plants. Everything we eat, including meat from animals (which feed on plants) is a result of plants using the energy in sunlight to take carbon dioxide and create complex carbon-containing molecules.
