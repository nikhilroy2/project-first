<h2> What are plants? </h2>

<p>Plants are living organisms that cover much of the land of planet Earth. You see them everywhere. They include grass, trees, flowers, bushes, ferns, mosses, and more. Plants are members of the kingdom plantae.</p>

<h2> What makes a plant a plant? </h2>

<p>Here are some basic characteristics that make a living organism a plant: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Most plants make their own food through a process called photosynthesis.</li>
	
    <li>Plants have a cuticle, meaning they have a waxy layer on their surface that protects them and keeps them from drying out.</li>
	
    <li>They have eukaryotic cells with rigid cell walls.</li>
	
    <li>They reproduce with spores or with sex cells.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Plant Cell</h2>

<p>Plant cells are composed of rigid cell walls made of cellulose, chloroplasts (which help with photosynthesis), a nucleus, and large vacuoles filled with water.</p>

<h2> Energy from the Sun</h2>

<p>One of the most important functions of most plants is photosynthesis. Plants use photosynthesis to create energy directly from sunlight. You can go here to learn more about photosynthesis.</p>

<h2> Types of Plants</h2>

<p>There are many different types of plants. They are typically divided into two major groups: vascular and nonvascular.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Vascular - These plants have specific tissues that help to move materials such as water through the plant. They are further divided into non-flowering plants and flowering plants. Most of the organisms you probably think of as plants, such as trees, bushes, and flowers, fit into this group.</li>
    
	<li>Nonvascular - These are smaller plants, such as mosses, that use diffusion and osmosis to move material through the plant.</li>
</ul>
